	<h2> What is The Daily Drip</h2>
        <p><span class="feature">The Daily Drip</span> is a generic coffee shop that we created. It daily serves several coffees to its loyal customers hence the name <strong>Daily Drip.</strong></p>
        <p>We just rolled out our new <strong> Daily specials, which you can check out by pressing the menu button on the right side of the dark green navigation panel</strong>; these are coffee specials for a specific day. This engaging website which our customers can check the daily specials for the coming days, was created by <strong> Web Developer </strong> that we hired, and now he will walk us through the process of creating the website and inform us how it functions.

			<H2> How the website was created </H2>
		 <b>First in index html </b> we commented out the portion where we wanted our template to be using the comment tag and copied it to our js file. This will hide the whole portion from the webpage and let us substitute the values to modify it later. After that, we created a div with an id attribute of coffee-cup. This will hold the coffee template that we created. Next, we needed a function to store our coffee template called coffeeTemplate and wired it to document the element id of coffee-cup (that is the id that we created) and to our function called coffeeTemplate (this is the fuction that we just created)
		 </p>
		 <H2> Coffee Template and Daily specials </H2>
		<p>
			After creating our function, we assigned a new date to date, declared our variable coffee, and initially assigned it as an empty string. Then declared variable today and  assigned .getday() on our object myDate. The getDay() method returns the day of the week as a number, where Sunday is represented by 0, Monday by 1, and so on, up to Saturday, represented by 6. We needed to create a loop that iterates through the days of the week, so we created 7 cases and declared 8 variables and assigned values to each of them. All the variables will be the same for all 7 cases, but the assigned values will change as the day changes, letting our website exhibit a different look daily to the customers, as we said earlier. Then we substituted the particular word that needs to be changed daily with the 8 variables that we just created so that it will change as the the day changes. We also wanted the background to change daily, so we wired our HTML to document query and set our background-color to cofeecolor( one of the 8 variables that are special to a specific day).
		</p>
		<H2> Navigation Bar, Days and Final touches </H2>
		<p>
			We created a link to all Days of the week and populated the navigation bar that we just imported from the portal project that we recently finished and named it “daily specials.” The NavBar will hide our Days and give the page a slick look. For our Title, we gave it a different color and changed the font color and font family of our slogan also matched the navigation bar background color to our H1 color finishing our new and excellent Website.
